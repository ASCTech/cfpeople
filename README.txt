-- SUMMARY --

This project is hosted at GitHub:
  http://github.com/mitchellshelton/cfpeople

This project does not meet the standards set for applying for 
a Drupal.org CVS account (http://drupal.org/node/539608) and 
will therefore be hosted on GitHub only. While I understand that
hosting Drupal module code outside of drupal.org in some users 
opinions hurts Drupal, I do not feel that my module contributes
appropriately to the Drupal community. If you believe that this 
module should be on Drupal.org please feel free to contact a CVS
reviewer and request the addition of the module.
